#Using the VAE Model for Training MedMNIST with different modalities
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model to train on the MedMNIST dataset. The MedMNIST dataset is a collection of medical images designed to facilitate the development of machine learning models for biomedical applications. This project focuses on applying a VAE to learn the latent representations of the medical images, which can be used for various downstream tasks such as image reconstruction, anomaly detection, and more.
